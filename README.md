# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project i designed a website for my internet media agency, i used only superficial information in order to give the design more importance.
i designed a menu and a image of our logo in the header section, the actual website is in the body section.

In this site i used list items to create the menus and the carousel used in index file.

the sass variables file is used in order to change primary colors in the website, similarly as some editors in wordpress (they use PHP variables to change colors).
in the contact file i included a contact form, i embeded a video from youtube in the about file.

I used 3 media queries in order to make my content responsive in desktops, laptops, etc... / tablets/ipads / smartphones.
